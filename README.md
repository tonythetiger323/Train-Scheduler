## About This Project:
Train-Scheduler is a site I had to make for homework, as part of the Northwestern University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, whose purpose was to demonstrate my understanding of using firebase and moment.js.

Train-Scheduler was built with HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap4, Javascript, JQuery 3.3.1, Firebase, and moment.js

## How to Use:
Enter train name, the name of the train's destination, the time the first train comes, and how often the train runs in minutes. That data will then be submitted and stored in Firebase and moment.js is used to calculate when the next time the train will come is and how many minutes away that is. Finally, all the data will be written to the DOM/
